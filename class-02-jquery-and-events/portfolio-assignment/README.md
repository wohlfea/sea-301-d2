Continue building and improving your portfolio site. Here's how you can leverage events:

## User Stories: MVP
  1. As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.
  1. As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.

## User Stories: Stretch Goals
  1. As a reader, I want project descriptions truncated to the first paragraph so that I can easily scroll though the whole list.
  1. As a reader, I want to click the "More" button so that I can expand the entire description.
  1. As a reader, I want projects filterable by category so that I can review just the things that interest me.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
  - Use event delegation whenever appropriate.
  - Add your filters to the Nav section.
  - Do as much work as you can with advanced selectors, rather than littering your markup with classes and ids.
  - When classes and IDs are needed, pick semantic names. There is to be no `$('#content .content')` nonsense!
  - Add color and icons where appropriate.
