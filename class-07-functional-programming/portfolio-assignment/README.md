# Assignment for Class 7 - Functional Programming

Scopes and closures and IIFE's, oh my!

Apply some functional programming concepts to your portfolio codebase.

 - Eliminate all `for` loops.
 - Use `map` where you are transforming one collection into another.
 - Enclose the contents of each script file in an IIFE, that exports any interface methods.
 - Use templates to avoid repetition of HTML structure. Use `map` to convert collections of data into collections of DOM nodes.
 - Think of a useful way to use `reduce`. Maybe you want to put some "fun facts stats" in your footer?
