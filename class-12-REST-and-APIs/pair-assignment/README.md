# Pair Assignment for Class 12 - REST and APIs

Now that we understand how applications can handle different URLs, we can write code that communicates with other applications.

## User Stories: MVP
 1. As a developer, I want to treat my GitHub repositories as a resource (with full MVC components), so that I can manage them within my blog.
  - You already have an `aboutController.js`,
  - so we need to add a `repo.js` model file,
  - and a `repoView.js` presentation layer.
  - GitHub API credentials should be stored in a local file (`githubToken.js`), but not committed to GitHub. Use `.gitignore` to prevent the file from being tracked (get help in lab if you don't know how to use `.gitignore`).
 - As the site owner, I want to highlight certain repos on my `/about` page so that everyone can see the great projects I am working on.
  - Retrieve and manipulate repo info in your model file.
  - You can choose exactly what API end point to use.
  - Craft an API query to return repos that you want to highlight.
  - Create a template in your view file to display these repos. You can build your template with either plan jQuery (string concatenation), or with Handlebars.

## User Stories: Stretch goals
 1. As the site owner, I want my lists of GitHub activity well designed, so visitors like looking at my page.
 1. As the site owner, I also want to show off other recent GitHub activity, so that everyone knows how active I am on GitHub.
  - Get creative with the data available to you via the GitHub API!
  - Want to create links to your gists?
  - Maybe highlight your GitHub followers, or whom you follow?

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
 - Ensure your code passes ESLint.
 - Place all code within the proper layer of MVC abstraction and encapsulation.
 - Use a proxied, authenticated ajax call to GitHub's API to get your repos.
 - DO NOT publish your GitHub Token to any public repo.
