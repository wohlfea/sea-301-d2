# Assignment for Class 14 - Managing Application State

Where does did our UI management logic go?? It's time to turn filters back on. But now we can use our new tools of routing, MVC separation, and resource rendering.

## User Stories: MVP
 1. As a reader, I want to filter articles by category, so I can discover the articles I'm most interested in.

## User Stories: Stretch Goals
 1. As an author, I want my own URL, so that I can share all my posts in one place.
 - As a reader, I want articles abbreviated on the index page, so that I can scan the list faster to decide what I want to click through to read.
 - As a reader, I want to comment on articles, so that I can share my awesome insights with other readers.


## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
 1. Ensure your code passes ESLint.
 - Filters should now work with the browser's back/forward buttons.
 - DRY code by using Page.js middleware: chain calls that handle routes where appropriate.
 - Pipeline object transformations with `.map` where appropriate.
