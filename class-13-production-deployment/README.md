# Pair and Individual Coding Assignments for Class 13 - Production Deployment

#### NOTE: This assignment applies to both the pair coding (blog) and the individual (portfoloio) assignments for Class 13.

Ready to share what you've made with the world? Yes!

Then you need to push your code to a web server accessible to the whole Internet. This is your "production environment".

We'll be using Heroku as our production server. Heroku is a "Platform as a Service": your code is plugged in to pre-configured servers, and is started up for the world to access.

## User Stories: MVP
 1. As a developer, I want my app to run in a development environment that matches production, so that I can reduce bugs related to infrastructure surprises.
 - As a developer, I want my secret tokens accessed only through environment variables, so that I can keep them secure.
 - As a site owner, I want my site running on a robust hosting platform, so that I don't have to hire a sysadmin.

## User Stories: Stretch Goals
 1. As a site owner, I want [www.my-own-domain-name.io] hooked up to my Heroku app, so that I don't have to explain to people how to spell "myblog.herokuapp.com" over the phone.
 - As a site owner, I want my root domain to redirect to the `www` subdomain, so people can type in either one to load my app.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
 - Ensure your code passes ESLint
 - Do not create your Heroku app with a default name.
 - Link to your live site in your README, for whichever repo you deploy.
