# Templates

Fix up the blog codebase, so it's properly using Handlebars templates.

1. _In your HTML file, include handlebars.js (use a CDN or download the file) and create a template that uses Handlebars syntax._
1. _Modify your Javascript code to use Handlebars' .compile() method, which returns a function; use that function to generate new articles and attach those articles to your DOM._

You should be familiar with the pair flow by now. If not, review previous instructions.

## Submit your assignment

When you are finished with your work (or if time runs out), then submit your work. To do this, you'll create a PR to the upstream repo with your changes, and submit that PR link in Canvas.

See previous instructions, if you'd like to review the steps.
