# Templates

Fix up the blog codebase, so it's properly using Handlebars templates.
1. In your HTML file, include handlebars.js (use a CDN or download the file) and create a template that uses Handlebars syntax.
1. Modify your Javascript code to use Handlebars' .compile() method, which returns a function; use that function to generate new articles and attach those articles to your DOM.

You should be familiar with the pair flow by now. If not, review previous instructions.

## Write code together

Find those `TODO` items in the codebase, and tackle each one of them.

1. Driver: Ensure you copy the starter code folder to a new folder named for your pair!
1. Now cd into that new folder. This is where you will write code.
1. Type `atom .` to open the new folder as a project in Atom.
1. Use the Atom "Find in Project" feature to locate all the TODO items.
1. Work through one or two TODO items, testing your code as you go, until you are happy with how it's working.

## Switch roles
1. Navigator: You can now clone the driver's fork, to your own local dev environment. As a collaborator, you can `pull` and `push` changes.
1. Handoff: The navigator now becomes the driver. The new driver now opens the code in Atom (see above), and has hands on the keyboard to work through the next one or two TODO items.

## Submit your assignment

When you are finished with your work (or if time runs out), then submit your work. To do this, you'll create a PR to the upstream repo with your changes, and submit that PR link in Canvas.

See previous instructions, if you'd like to review the steps.
