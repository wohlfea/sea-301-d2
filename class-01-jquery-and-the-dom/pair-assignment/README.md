# MVC blog

Work with the provided starter code to add structure and functionality a basic Blog web site.

The code has some unfinished features. Your help is needed to complete it!

Search through the code for:

 `// TODO: ...`

 comments, where features should be. Replace the comments and any related pseudo-code with real, working code.

Work in pairs. Take turns as "driver" and "navigator".

## Getting started with pair programming

Take a moment to shake hands and introduce yourselves.

You and your pair will have different experience levels, which is normal. You'll have opportunities to both teach and learn from your pair. Keep an open mind, and always be kind.

The workflow may take a little getting used to, if you haven't done pairing before, so give yourself time to work through any git issues (aka: "gituations") that arise.

## Setup your repo

Here is a recommended workflow:

1. Driver: fork this repository to your own account. This original repo (the one at `github.com/codefellows`) is the "upstream" repo.
1. Your **forked repo** on GitHub will be your "origin" repo. Clone YOUR FORK to your local development environment.
1. Use this command, so that your local repo knows about the upstream repo:
  - `git remote add upstream git-url-here`
  - (replace `git-url-here` with the proper git-URL of the upstream repo).
1. Now, you can sync changes from the upstream repo to your local master branch whenever you need them (do this at least daily):
  - `git pull upstream master`

## Write code together

Now find those `TODO` items in the code, and tackle one of them.

1. Driver: In your terminal, change directory into the `pair-assignemnt` folder.
1. Copy the starter code folder to a new folder named for your pair:
 - `cp -r starter-code/ sabrina-chris/`
1. Now cd into that new folder. This is where you will write code.
1. Type `atom .` to open the new folder as a project in Atom.
1. Use the Atom "Find in Project" feature to locate all the TODO items.
1. Work through one or two TODO items, testing your code as you go, until you are happy with how it's working.

## Switch roles
1. Driver: On GitHub, Add your navigator as a collaborator to your origin repo.
1. Navigator: You can now clone the driver's fork, to your own local dev environment. Since you are a collaborator, you can `pull` and `push` changes.
1. Switch roles: The new driver now opens the code in Atom (see above), and has hands on the keyboard to work through the next one or two TODO items.

## Submit your assignment

When you are finished with your work (or if time runs out), then submit your work. To do this, you'll create a "Pull Request" (aka: "PR") to the upstream repo with your changes, and submit that PR link in Canvas.

1. Ensure that all your local changes are committed, and pushed to your `origin` repo.
2. Visit the origin repo on github.com.
1. Create a new PR.
1. Carefully review the PR, and ensure the code is going back to the upstream repo.
1. Write a good descriptive summary of your changes:
  - Be sure to include how much time you spent on it.
  - Briefly reflect on and summarize your process.
1. When you create the PR, it will have a unique URL. Copy this link, and paste it into the assignment submission form in Canvas. Both the driver and the navigator will submit the same PR link.
